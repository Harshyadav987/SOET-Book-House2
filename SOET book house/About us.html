       Hello,Welcome to "SOET Book House".We Are first tear BTech. students at CUh. Commonly we all arrange books
       related to our syllabus from library.At all times we might imcapable of coming to library to get required book,
       althrough we go there is possibility of not getting book,so we came up with an idea introducing a portal where we
       get to know the availability of books along with their count at any place & time.There is a seperate column for 
       upcoming books,novels,journals & we made it easy to use to get best experience but first you must register yourself.
       <br><br>
       For time being we introduced this only for CSE Btech. students. On further we are planning to come up the same for 
       other branches too.
       <br><br>
       This initation started by Utsavi,Saravanth and Harsh... Thank you
